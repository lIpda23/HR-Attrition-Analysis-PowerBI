# HR-Analytics-PowerBI

This is an HR Data Analytics portfolio project focusing on key metrics such as performance tracking and attrition rates. The project involves data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization using Power BI to create interactive dashboards for understanding employee attrition patterns.

### Project Overview
The original dataset contained over 80K records. For the purpose of this analysis, the dataset was cleaned and processed, resulting in a final dataset of 76K records used in this Power BI project. Data cleaning and transformation were conducted using Power BI's Query Editor, ensuring that only relevant and high-quality data were utilized.

### Tools Used
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Power BI Query Editor
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Microsoft Power BI

### Data Visualizations
1. **Entity Relationship Diagram**: Shows the relationships between employee, performance, and satisfaction data.
2. **Attrition Analysis Dashboard**: Interactive visuals that provide insights into employee attrition based on different factors such as department, overtime, and job role.

### Files in this Repository
- **CSV Folder**: Contains the cleaned datasets used for analysis.
- **Power BI File Folder**: Includes the Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`).
- **Visualization Folder**: Screenshots of the Power BI visualizations and dashboards.

### Key Insights
- The cleaned dataset allowed us to accurately analyze which departments had the highest attrition rates and what factors (e.g., overtime, job role) contributed to employee turnover.
- Visual insights provided actionable information for HR teams to develop targeted strategies to reduce attrition.
