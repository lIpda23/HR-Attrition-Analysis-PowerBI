# HR-Analytics-PowerBI


This is an HR Data Analytics portfolio project focusing on key metrics such as performance tracking and attrition rates. The project aims to assist Atlas Labs in understanding the factors driving employee turnover and developing strategies to improve retention.

### Project Overview
The original dataset contained over 80K records. For the purpose of this analysis, the dataset was cleaned and processed, resulting in a final dataset of 76K records used in this Power BI project. Data cleaning and transformation were conducted using Microsoft Excel and Power BI's Query Editor, ensuring that only relevant and high-quality data were utilized.

### Key Insights
- **Age Distribution**: Majority of employees are between 20-29 years old.
- **Gender Ratio**: Atlas Labs employs 2.7% more women than men.
- **Diversity**:
  - Non-binary employees make up 8.5% of the workforce.
  - White employees have the highest average salary, while mixed ethnic groups have one of the lowest.
 
### Business Recommendations
- **Retention Focus**: Improve engagement/training programs for younger employees (20-29 years) to enhance their retention.
- **Salary Fairness Review**: Review salary structure to ensure fairness, especially among mixed ethnic groups.
- **Diversity Initiatives**: Enhance support for non-binary employees, who represent a significant proportion of the workforce.
